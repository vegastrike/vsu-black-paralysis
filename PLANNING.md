LONG TERM PLANNING
------------------


Gameplay Content/Style:
-----------------------

This perhaps is going to be the biggest differential between Vegastrike and the
other mods based on the engine.  The game I've played that comes closest to
my intentions for Black-Paralysis is 'Sub Culture' by Ubisoft, althogh even
that isn't an exact match.

At it's heart, Black-Paralysis will be story driven, with a central, *linear*,
plot.  Yes, I know linear is terribly unfashinable these days, but first and
foremost I'm telling a story, not just designing a universe.  However, just
because the story is linear, the player's actions don't need to be set in
stone.  The player may be able to choose different mission paths in the main
plot, and will be able to participate in side-plots or extra missions as he
wishes.

The outcomes of these additional paths will influence the interaction the
player has with the plot, absence of attendence at major battles could well be
decided on whether the player decided to run that inventory check over at the
munitions store!  These side plots will be numerous, and at least partially
interesting, if not absolutely compelling!

As for style, I intend big battles to play like X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter, scouting
missions to play like Darklight Conflict (an old dos game), and base
interactions like, well, Wing Commander I guess (I have a grand vision of lots
of interaction ... participating in poker nights etc ... I don't know how far
that'll get).  The rest I guess will come out how it does, in Black-Paralysis'
own unique (or not) style!

Something else that should be mentioned is the extensive set of introductory
missions, 'disguised' as a yearly evaluation for possible promotion.  Or
possibly putting a prototype ship through its paces.


Possible Side Missions:
-----------------------

Critical Fission Reactor: Shield, tractor, and deliver to disposal/recycle area
Race: Race around some buoys in the ship yard/training yard or something
Relay Repair: Provide transport for an repair engineering team during battle
...and others.


The player, and plot:
---------------------

Plot specifics are a combination of not written and private thoughts, but are
unlikely to be anywhere near coherence in the near term (even when they are, I
expect them to continually change for a while).  The events that occur in the
game occur approximately 50 years (again, to be decided) after Vegastrike
starts.

Generalities are quite numerous at the moment.  Black-Paralysis is a classified
project, aboard a research station in the Arachnis Sector.  The Arachnis Sector
is the most secure set of systems in the Confedaracy, with just one, one way
link back to the main jump network.  Discovered by a long range SPEC-Survey
Cruiser, it has since become one of the main activity areas for Confederate
research activities.  The second largest contributing factor to this status
is the high degree of Ancient remnants found throughout the system.  The
sector is home to systems containing the richest discovered remains of the
Ancients outside of the Uln Homeworld.  Partial remnants of past Ancient
habitation have been found on several planets within the sector.  Eclipsing
this however, was the discovery of a partial drive system for an Ancient ship,
found buried in a fissure of a minor planetoid, located in a rather large
asteroid belt.  This drive is the subject of the most intense research, which
is conducted jointly with the Rlaan (with the physical attendence of
Rlaan-Briin).  Apart from that, there aren't really many more specifics I've
decided on, they'll come as the game comes.

The player's identity isn't much more degined, mainly because it has even less
need to be than the Sector.  You are an engineer, who's days are spent test
flying modified ships.  At least, when there is test flying to be done.  In
the on duty off hours, you do a lot of equipment/prototype transport around the
research centres.  After the initial Aeran attack, you are left as one of the
only non-military pilots in the sector, and thus get involved in quite a lot of
work.  The details of such work are, of course, not finalised.



Miscellaneous:
--------------

Yes, there is stuff I haven't mentioned above, or elsewhere, and am unlikely
to.  Some things can just wait till I try implementing them!  If anyone per
chance reads this and becomes interested, then by all means ask questions, or
start hacking ... who knows, you might even pull me away from Vegastrike enough
to start doing some serious work on Black-Paralysis!
