README
------

Black-Paralysis is still in the very early stages.  The data set you have
is not only very incomplete, but is one of many circulating through my
home directory and various cds.  Consider yourself warned.

If your data set is under say, 2 MB in size, you have the base data set.
The base data set is intended as a starting point for total conversion
mods.

The minimal data set, which comes in at about 50 MB, is intended for learning
how to mod VS.  Most of the features are utilised to some extent, so you get
to know what VS is capable of.

For any technical questions about modding, see the Vegastrike WIKI resource:

        -->  http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/  <--

or visit the Vegastrike forums:

        -->  http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/forums/  <--

or you can contact me on the black-paralysis mailing list:

          o Video card: 3d card with 16 MB of memory (although it will work
                                                     without a 3d card too)
          o Screen color depth: 16 bit
          o RAM: 256 MB
          o Swap space: ???
          o HD: As above.

    * Reasonable Minimum Requirement
          o Processor: Pentium III 500 MHz
          o Video card: 3d card with 32 MB of memory, and HT&L support
          o Screen color depth: 16 bit
          o RAM: 384 MB

          o Processor: x MHz, where x -> infinity as 3l337ness -> 1
          o Video card: for (long i=0;i<this_year.length();i++)
                            {newCard(i,USD(500));}
          o Screen color depth: 32 bit
