    * Version 20050902 done.
        In case you didn't notice, the initial release wasn't really much of a
        release at all.  I am now correcting that, with a release that has a
        working autoconf/make system.  It currently will not create anything
        that will work with any released vegastrike binary (or cvs for that
        matter), but the problems preventing this are known, and fixes are only
        to be implemented in the main tree.
        Stil both 100% cruft and content free ;-)
    	
        Known Issues:
          + The armour error you will get upon loading the data set is due to
            the fact that the default (non existant) craft you fly has a mass
            of 0.  A units.csv file will fix this.
          + The make system will not work due to non-existant directories.

    	That's right.  I finally got around to releasing something.  Sure, it
        is the absolute minimum required to even start Vegastrike, but it's a
        good start for anyone interested in doing a completely new game using
        vegastrike.
    	Both 100% cruft and content free ;-)
    	
    	Oh yeah, the resource files don't seem to work with VS for some reason.
    	Hopefully a fix will be shortly forthcoming.
