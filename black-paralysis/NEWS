    * Version 20050902 done.
        In case you didn't notice, the initial release wasn't really much of a
        release at all.  I am now correcting that, with a release that has a
        working autoconf/make system.  It currently will not create anything
        that will work with any released vegastrike binary (or cvs for that
        matter), but the problems preventing this are known, and fixes are only
        to be implemented in the main tree.
        Stil both 100% cruft and content free ;-)
    	
        On a related note, the armour error you will get upon loading the data
        set is due to the fact that the default (non existant) craft you fly
        has a mass of 0.  I will use a dummy units.csv file in the future to
        remove this error.

    	That's right.  I finally got around to releasing something.  Sure, it
        is the absolute minimum required to even start Vegastrike, but it's a
        good start for anyone interested in doing a completely new game using
        vegastrike.

    	Oh yeah, the resource files don't seem to work with VS for some reason.
    	Hopefully a fix will be shortly forthcoming.
